# FountainAI Ensemble Service Development Plan (Dockerized Workflow)

## The FountainAI Ensemble Service

### Introduction

This README outlines a **specification-driven development strategy** for implementing the FountainAI Ensemble Service **FastAPI** application in a fully **Dockerized** local development environment. The **FountainAI Ensemble Service** is a core component of the FountainAI ecosystem, facilitating structured interactions between **users**, the **OpenAI Assistant SDK** (The Assistant), and various **FountainAI services**. 

It dynamically generates **system prompts** based on the **OpenAPI specifications** of each integrated FountainAI service.

Read its [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/Contexter/Ensemble-Service/blob/main/service/openapi3_1.yml) .


### Project Organization and Script Management

To ensure a consistent and unambiguous **project structure**, the repository follows a standardized **folder layout** with a clear **root directory** and explicitly defined **paths**. The root directory of the project is `/service`.

**Notes:**

The root of the project is `/service`, with all paths relative to this root. The `openapi3_1.yml` file is located at the `/service` root directory. All **scripts** are housed within the `scripts/` directory at the root of the repository, while the `app/` directory contains the **FastAPI application code**, adhering to standard conventions.

### Path Adaptation Based on Environment

**Environment variables** are utilized to define **base paths**, ensuring that scripts and code can adapt to different **execution contexts**, such as running inside versus outside **Docker**. All paths within scripts are explicitly defined relative to the `/service` root directory to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency.

### Instructions for Running Scripts

All **scripts** are executed within **Docker containers** to maintain a consistent environment. From the root directory of the repository, you can build and run the **Docker environment** using **Docker Compose** with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The `setup_fountainai_ensemble.py` script is executed within the Docker container to perform initial **setup tasks**.

### Overview: Spec driven development from OpenAPI to OpenAPI

The development strategy centers around using the **OpenAPI specification** as a guide while leveraging **FastAPI’s automatic OpenAPI schema generation**. This involves defining **Pydantic models** and **FastAPI routes** that align with the OpenAPI specification, enhancing the automatically generated OpenAPI schema using **route decorators** to include additional metadata such as `summary`, `description`, and `operation_id`. The approach avoids overriding FastAPI’s default OpenAPI generation process and includes validating the generated OpenAPI schema against the original specification to ensure consistency. **Code generation** and **integration** are automated using **modular scripts** within a **Dockerized environment**.

**Note:** The **OpenAPI specification** resides in this repository at `openapi3_1.yml` in the `/service` root directory. This file should be referred to when implementing the application to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Implementation Plan Using Modular Scripts

## Dockerized Local Development Workflow

### Advantages of Setting Up Docker First

Establishing **Docker** from the beginning offers numerous benefits. It eliminates **environment inconsistencies** by ensuring all development occurs within a unified environment. **Dependency management** is simplified as dependencies are handled within the Docker container, preventing conflicts with local Python environments. This approach also **eases onboarding** for new developers, allowing them to start contributing without navigating complex setup procedures. Additionally, **Docker** facilitates **testing** and **deployment** by providing a consistent setup across all development and production stages. **Early Docker setup** aids in the prompt detection of any **compatibility issues** with **containerization**, preventing significant development efforts from being wasted on unresolved issues.

### Workflow Steps

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose

Ensure that **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your local machine. Refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for detailed instructions.

#### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository and navigate to the `/service` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Contexter/Ensemble-Service.git
cd Ensemble-Service/service
```

#### Configure the Docker Environment

Create the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` in the `/service` root directory as per the prompts provided in **Step 1**. Ensure that the Docker configurations are set up to support a seamless **local development workflow**.

#### Build and Start the Docker Environment

Use the generated `run_setup.sh` script to automate the setup process:

```bash
chmod +x run_setup.sh
./run_setup.sh
```

This command will build the Docker image for the **FastAPI application**, start the **FastAPI application** and **Typesense services**, and execute the `setup_fountainai_ensemble.py` script inside the Docker container to set up the project.

#### Develop and Test

With the **Docker environment** running, you can engage in development and testing activities. **Editing code locally** will reflect changes inside the container due to **volume mounting**. **Access the application** by visiting [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). To run tests inside the container, execute:

```bash
docker-compose exec app bash
pytest
```

The application should be fully functional after running the initial scripts, including the basic **FastAPI app** created by `create_directory_structure.py`.

#### Shut Down the Environment

When development is complete, you can stop the Docker containers with:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Notes on Volume Mounting and Environment Variables

#### Volume Mounting

The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to **mount your local project directory** into the Docker container. This setup allows you to make changes locally and have them take effect inside the container without the need to rebuild the Docker image each time.

#### Environment Variables

Manage **environment variables** using a `.env` file to maintain development settings. It is crucial to ensure that **sensitive information** is not committed to **version control systems** to maintain security.

## Next Steps

1. **Initiate a GPT-4 Session:** Provide the **prompts** to generate the Docker configurations and Python scripts, ensuring they are compatible with execution inside **Docker** and that all paths are explicitly defined relative to `/service`.
2. **Configure the Docker Environment:** Create the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` in the `/service` root directory as per the prompts before proceeding with any other implementation steps.
3. **Execute the Python Scripts:** Run the scripts within the Docker container to set up the project environment.
4. **Validate the FastAPI Implementation:** Use the `validate_openapi_schema.py` script to ensure the **FastAPI application** aligns with the **OpenAPI specification**.
5. **Write and Run Tests:** Utilize the `generate_tests.py` script to create and execute tests inside the Docker container, verifying the application’s functionality.
6. **Use Version Control:** Implement **version control practices** to track changes and facilitate collaboration among team members.
7. **Enhance Routes with Metadata:** When defining **FastAPI routes**, use **decorators** to add `summary`, `description`, and `operation_id` to enrich the **OpenAPI documentation**, ensuring comprehensive and accurate API documentation.
