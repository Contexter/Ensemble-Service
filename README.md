# FountainAI Ensemble Service Development Plan (Dockerized Workflow)

## Introduction

This guide outlines a **specification-driven development strategy** for implementing the **FountainAI Ensemble Service** as a **FastAPI** application within a fully **Dockerized** local development environment. The FountainAI Ensemble Service is a core component of the FountainAI ecosystem, facilitating structured interactions between **users**, the **OpenAI Assistant SDK** (The Assistant), and various **FountainAI services**. It dynamically generates **system prompts** based on the **OpenAPI specifications** of each integrated FountainAI service.

Read its [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/Contexter/Ensemble-Service/blob/main/service/openapi3_1.yml).

## Project Organization and Script Management

To ensure a consistent and unambiguous **project structure**, the repository follows a standardized **folder layout** with a clear **root directory** and explicitly defined **paths**. The root directory of the project is `/service`.

## Implementation Using Modular Scripts

### Overview

The development workflow utilizes **modular Python scripts** placed within the `/service/scripts/` directory. Each script performs a specific task, contributing to the overall setup of the FountainAI Ensemble Service. The `setup_fountainai_ensemble.py` script orchestrates the execution of all these scripts in the correct order.

Below is a detailed description of each script, including its purpose and the prompt that defines its functionality.

### 1. generate\_dockerfile.py

**Description:**

This script generates a `Dockerfile` in the `/service` root directory, setting up the **Docker environment** with the necessary configurations for the **FastAPI application**.

**Prompt:**

> Generate a script named `generate_dockerfile.py` that will be placed in `/service/scripts/`. This script creates a `Dockerfile` in the `/service` root directory that uses an official Python base image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`). It should set the working directory to `/service` to prevent recursive directory structures, install required system packages, copy the application code and scripts into the container ensuring files are placed correctly, install Python dependencies using `pip`, set environment variables as needed, and specify the command to run the **FastAPI application** using **Uvicorn**.

### 2. generate\_docker\_compose.py

**Description:**

This script generates a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `/service` root directory, defining the **services** required for the **FastAPI application** and **Typesense**, along with necessary configurations.

**Prompt:**

> Generate a script named `generate_docker_compose.py` that will be placed in `/service/scripts/`. This script creates a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `/service` root directory that defines services for the **FastAPI application** and **Typesense**. It should mount **volumes** to allow code changes to be reflected without rebuilding the image, expose necessary **ports**, set up **network configurations**, and include **environment variables** for development settings.

### 3. create\_directory\_structure.py

**Description:**

This script creates the necessary **directories** and **initial files** for the FountainAI Ensemble Service relative to the `/service` root directory, ensuring a minimal but functional **FastAPI application** setup.

**Prompt:**

> Generate a script named `create_directory_structure.py` that will be placed in `/service/scripts/`. This script creates the necessary **directories** and **initial files** for the FountainAI Ensemble Service relative to the `/service` root directory. It should create the following directories: `/service/app/`, `/service/app/api/routes/`, `/service/app/models/`, `/service/app/schemas/`, `/service/app/crud/`, `/service/app/core/`, `/service/app/auth/`, `/service/app/typesense/`, and `/service/app/tests/`. Additionally, it should create the **initial files**: `/service/app/main.py` with a basic FastAPI app instance, `/service/app/api/routes/__init__.py`, `/service/app/api/routes/root.py` with a root endpoint, and `__init__.py` files in each package as needed. The script should ensure that after execution, there is a minimal but functional FastAPI application that can be run and will respond to requests. It should print a **confirmation message** for each directory and file created. Ensure that the script is compatible with execution inside a Docker container and that all paths are explicitly defined relative to `/service`.

### 4. generate\_minimal\_main.py

**Description:**

This script generates a minimal **`main.py`** in `/service/app/` to ensure that the FastAPI application can run independently. This minimal setup includes the FastAPI instance and a simple root endpoint.

**Prompt:**

> Generate a script named `generate_minimal_main.py` that will be placed in `/service/scripts/`. This script creates a minimal `/service/app/main.py` with a basic FastAPI app instance and a simple root endpoint (`/`). The minimal `main.py` should allow the FastAPI application to start and respond to requests without dependencies on other components. It should overwrite any existing `main.py` file, provide a **confirmation message** upon completion, and ensure compatibility with Docker by explicitly defining all paths relative to `/service`.

### 5. generate\_authentication.py

**Description:**

This script creates **authentication dependencies** in `/service/app/auth/dependencies.py` based on the **OpenAPI specification**, implementing **API key authentication mechanisms**.

**Prompt:**

> Generate a script named `generate_authentication.py` that will be placed in `/service/scripts/`. This script creates `/service/app/auth/dependencies.py` with **authentication dependencies** as per the **OpenAPI specification** located at `/service/openapi3_1.yml`. It should implement the **API key authentication mechanisms** for both `apiKeyAuth` and `adminApiKeyAuth`, ensuring that the dependencies validate API keys correctly and raise appropriate **HTTP exceptions**. The script should overwrite any existing file and confirm upon completion. Ensure compatibility with Docker and that paths are explicitly defined relative to `/service`.

### 6. generate\_openapi\_parser.py

**Description:**

This script creates an **OpenAPI parser module** in `/service/app/core/openapi_parser.py` that can be imported by other scripts to facilitate the parsing of the OpenAPI specification. This parser centralizes the logic for extracting necessary information from the OpenAPI file, promoting code reusability and consistency across scripts.

**Prompt:**

> Generate a script named `generate_openapi_parser.py` that will be placed in `/service/scripts/`. This script creates `/service/app/core/openapi_parser.py`, which contains a reusable **OpenAPI parser** class or functions to parse the **OpenAPI specification** located at `/service/openapi3_1.yml`. The parser should provide methods to extract **schemas**, **security schemes**, **paths**, **parameters** (categorized by path, query, header, and cookie), **responses**, **request bodies**, **tags**, **callbacks**, **examples**, **links**, **headers**, **content types**, **operation IDs**, **server information**, and **security requirements** needed by other scripts. It should also handle resolving `$ref` references, including both internal and external references, and provide validation of the loaded specification against the OpenAPI 3.1 schema. It should overwrite any existing parser file, provide a **confirmation message** upon completion, and ensure compatibility with Docker by explicitly defining all paths relative to `/service`.

With the **Docker environment** running, you can engage in development and testing activities. **Editing code locally** will reflect changes inside the container due to **volume mounting**.

- **Access the application** by visiting [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
- **Run tests inside the container**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec app bash
  pytest
  ```

The application should be fully functional after running the initial scripts, including the basic **FastAPI app** created by `generate_minimal_main.py`, authentication dependencies from `generate_authentication.py`, and the **OpenAPI parser** from `generate_openapi_parser.py`.

### Shut Down the Environment

When development is complete, you can stop the Docker containers with:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Notes on Volume Mounting and Environment Variables

#### Volume Mounting

The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to **mount your local project directory** into the Docker container. This setup allows you to make changes locally and have them take effect inside the container without the need to rebuild the Docker image each time.

#### Environment Variables

Manage **environment variables** using a `.env` file to maintain development settings. It is crucial to ensure that **sensitive information** is not committed to **version control systems** to maintain security.

## Script Execution Details

### setup\_fountainai\_ensemble.py

This master script ensures that all necessary scripts are executed in the correct sequence, handling dependencies appropriately.

**Execution Order within ****`setup_fountainai_ensemble.py`****:**

1. `generate_dockerfile.py`
2. `generate_docker_compose.py`
3. `create_directory_structure.py`
4. `generate_minimal_main.py`
5. `generate_authentication.py`
6. `generate_openapi_parser.py`
7. `generate_schemas.py`
8. `generate_models.py`
9. `generate_alembic_migration.py`
10. `generate_crud.py`
11. `generate_api_routes.py`
12. `generate_typesense_sync.py`
13. `generate_logging.py`
14. `generate_comprehensive_main.py`
15. `validate_openapi_schema.py`
16. `generate_tests.py`

This sequencing ensures that the minimal FastAPI application is operational with authentication dependencies and the OpenAPI parser before adding more complex components and configurations.

### run\_setup.sh

This shell script automates the Docker build and setup process, ensuring that all steps are executed smoothly.

**Script Steps:**

1. **Build and Start Docker Containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

2. **Wait for Services to Initialize:**

   Incorporate a delay or health checks to ensure services like the FastAPI app and Typesense are up and running.

3. **Execute Setup Script Inside the FastAPI Container:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app python scripts/setup_fountainai_ensemble.py
   ```

4. **Provide Echo Statements:**

   Inform the user about each step's progress and completion status.

**Sample ****`run_setup.sh`****:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting Docker containers..."
docker-compose up --build -d

echo "Waiting for services to initialize..."
sleep 10  # Adjust the sleep time as needed or implement health checks

echo "Executing setup script inside the FastAPI container..."
docker-compose exec app python scripts/setup_fountainai_ensemble.py

echo "Setup completed successfully!"
```

Ensure the script is **executable**:

```bash
chmod +x run_setup.sh
```

---

## Summary

By restructuring the development plan to first establish a **minimal FastAPI application**, then setting up **authentication dependencies**, and introducing an **OpenAPI parser**, we ensure that the service is operational early in the setup process. Subsequent scripts then incrementally enhance the application by adding schemas, models, migrations, CRUD operations, routes, synchronization with Typesense, logging, and comprehensive configurations. This approach promotes a stable foundation, allowing for easier debugging and validation at each step.

Following this guide will help you set up a fully Dockerized development environment for the FountainAI Ensemble Service, leveraging modular scripts to automate the creation of the application structure, configurations, and components based on the provided OpenAPI specification. This method ensures consistency, scalability, and ease of maintenance, aligning with best practices in modern software development.
